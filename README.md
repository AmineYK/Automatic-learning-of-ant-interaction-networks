Machine learning of interaction networks in the ant Temnothorax nylanderi
The aim of this project is to build and study by unsupervised and supervised learning
interaction networks between individuals of an ant colony and the impact of pollution on the communication
on the communication and the cognitive capacities of these animals. In ants it was shown that
that pollution negatively affects colonies [Jacquier et al., 2021]. The automatic learning of interaction networks and their modification linked to pollution should allow us to
determine if this negative impact is due to a behavioral alteration within the colonies.
The project has two parts. The first part concerns the pre-processing of raw data
which are video recordings; the second part is the learning of interaction networks and their
their evolution.
